- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abel Pinheiro
  
  Curious by nature, passionate about the unknown, and an enormous sense of Justice. Always trying to build bridges between different people and trying to be the glue that binds everyone together. Always ready to help a stranger, or a friend.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cybersecurity; Pentesting; Cyberdefense; Geopolitics; Books; Volunteer Work; Cycling; Music; Chess; Martial Arts; Travel; Data Analysis; Finance; Equity Research 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning for CompTIA PenTest+, and on THM platform, also how to be a better human beeing, and that is a work in progress to a never ending loop :relaxed:
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at abspi@tutanota.com otherwise, send a pigeon ðŸ˜„
- âš¡ Fun facts: I always have profound issues giving up.
   When I was a kid, my favourite question was WHY? Followed by an answer only to hear another, WHY? Still is today :grin:. Always brush my teeth with both ands: left for the morning, and right for the evening :smile:. Always avoid to go under construction sites :grimacing:.
