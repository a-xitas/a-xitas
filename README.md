- 📫 You can reach me at abspi@tutanota.com otherwise, send a pigeon 😄
- ⚡ Fun facts: I always have profound issues giving up.
   When I was a kid, my favourite question was WHY? Followed by an answer only to hear another, WHY? Still is today :grin:. Always brush my teeth with both ands: left for the morning, and right for the evening :smile:. Always avoid to go under temporary structures :grimacing:. Always leave the burnt part of the bread to the pigeons. I can never feel my hands dirty that I always have to rush to clean them.
